Anyways the oxygenated blood /blood cells flow through the arteries the biggest artery is the aorta which resides near the heart somehwere on top. the dexoygenated blood flows through the veins. Veins have valves because all it's doing is flowing back to the lungs to get its oxygen befoe arriving to the heart to get pumped through. The valves are to prevent backflow so that it goes in one direction. Arteries don't need valves because it has the pressure coming from our heart. our heart has 4 cahmbers the atrium and ventrical. Atrium is on top ventrical is on bottom ithink the left ventrical might be I want to say where the blood but nort sure. i know that blood also transport white blood cells and platelets. So yeah if there's ever a need for platelets /white blood say a foreign particle came in orwe got a scab and needed platelets to form a blood clot the blood would be the pathway for which white blood cells adn platelets can arrive. there are different blood types. the lungs are branched out arterioles capillaries?? anyways what happens is when we breathe the airtravels through these branches and arrives to the capillaries. Oh also in the diffusion exchange of gases carbon dioxide comes into the lungs and that's what we breathe out afte rour oxygen exchange. iron affects hemoglobins ability /capability of holding onto oxygen molecuesl so if we're iron deficient we're at risk of anemia and a symptom of anemia is feeling tired all teh time adn this couldbe because of the lack of oxygen. the hear'ts a muscle. the heart has two beats the first i think is strongest i think the sound of the heart comes from teh valves between the ventricles and the atrium. So I thnk the first beat comes from between teh two ventricles and the second one either from between the ventricle adn an atrium. not so sure. low blood pressure could potentially be from a weak heart since if the heart is weaker then the bloodflow that goes is not as strong hence lower pressure. high blood pressure could come from plaque buildup in our arteries from cholesterol deposits which limits flow causing more pressure to go. a herat attack is when the heart skips a beat I think?? You can also have a condition means you coudl poetentially have irregular heartbeats  arryhtmia. oxygenated blood is bright red whereas dexoygenated is darker. that's why use red for arteris and blue for veins in diagrams normally to represent oxygenated or deoxygenated blood. venous cava is our largest vein?? I'm not sure. there's a jugular vein.,MTDialogAgentEvent,14:59:01.000,00:19:12.731,(punctual),Pam,PamPKAFeedback,"Ok, now that we have gone over what you already know about the circulatory system, we need to create some good subgoals for learning about the system.

The circulatory system is composed of the heart, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins, and venules and also, in part, the lungs.  The heart has four quadrants; two atria, and two ventricles.  The ventricles are situated in teh lower half of the heart and the atria are in the upper half.  There are four valves in the heart, two that of of most importance and separate the atria from the ventricles so that there is no backflow.  Blood comes into the heart in the right atrium, deoxygenated, and then flows into the right ventricle.  This blood is pumped through the pulmonary circulation in order to become oxygenated.  The blood flows back into the left atrium, then intro the left ventricle, and is then pumped to the rest of the body since it is now oxygenated.  Almost 20% of this blood goes to the brain because of the brain's high oxygen consumption.  The initiation of the heart's pumping pattern is with the sinoatrial node (also known as the SA node).  This is a small area of the heart located in teh right atrium with special pacemaker cells.  These cells send a signal through the atria (to the left atrium), then to the atrioventricular node (AV node) which propagates the signal and is located between the atria and the ventricles.  Once through the AV node, the signal is sent down the bundle of His, to the bundle branches (all specialized cells) and then to the ventricles.  Any kind of change in this pattern (e.g. due to dead tissue or uneven pumping) could lead to a reentrant arrhythmia which could be deadly.  The largest artery in the body is the aorta which pumps oxygenated blood to the body.  The pulmonary veins are the only veins that carry oxygenated blood; all the others carry deoxygenated blood.  The pulmonary veins carry blood from the lungs to the heart.",MTDialogAgentEvent,13:51:02.000,00:13:01.608,(punctual),Pam,PamPKAFeedback,"Ok, now that we have gone over what you already know about the circulatory system, we need to create some good subgoals for learning about the system.

The heart is a muscle composed of cardiac muscle. It has 4 chambers; two atria and two ventricles. The heart uses eletrical activity from the atrio-ventricular node to drive the muscular activity which pumps blood to the entire body. The atri will drive the blood into the ventricles, which then pumps blood to both the lungs and the body. The right atria takes blood from the body and pumps it to the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood to the lungs. The left atria beings back the blood to the left ventricle (and note that the muscles of that chamber in the heart is much more pronounced) and pumps this to the rest of the body.#NL##NL#The lungs is where the gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs with the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (which was dissolved in the blood in the form of HCO3-) will leave the blood to be exhaled by our respiratory system. Hemoglobin (a protein abundant in out red blood cells) will take up 4 oxygen molecules (O2) and transport this much needed oxygen throughout the circulatory system to the capillaries where gas exchange occurs once more.#NL##NL#In the capillaries, oxygen diffuses to the muscles where they are used in aerobic respiration (using foodstuffs and oxygen to make ATP, the energy currency in the body). The blood takes back the excess carbon dioxide to the lungs to be exhaled.#NL##NL#Platelets are used in the circulatory system to make clots, which serve as a blockage to stop bleeding.

It provides blood from the heart containing nutrients and oxygen. It is carried away from the heart through ventricles and returns to the heart through veins. blood that goes out of the heart is oxygenated whereas the blood coming back through veins is deoxygenated. Blood also carries wastes from the body parts. It also controls the body temperature by circulating blood from highly activated body parts to other body parts. When body temperature is lower, capilary veins contracts  so that it minimizes the heat loss but when the body temperature is high, capilary veins expands to maximize heat loss around the surface. #NL#Megakaryocytes are in bone marrow. Platelets and red blood cells and white blood cells are present in the blood and when a disease is found white blood cells attack viruses and protects the body. Red blood cells help to repair damaged blood vessels. #NL#Blood goes through right atrium where it receives blood (deoxygenated blood) from the body. then it goes through right ventricle and through pulmonary artery to get to the lung. there the blood is oxygenated and it goes out to  left atrium  and to left ventricle.
